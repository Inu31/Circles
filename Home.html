                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>You may have come across objects in daily life, which are round in shape such as wheels of a vehcile, bangles, dials of many clocks, coins, key rings, button of shirts, etc. In a clock, you might have observed that the second's hand goes rund the dial of the clock rapidly and its top moves in a round path. This path traced by the tip of the second's hand is called a circle.</p>

                <h1>What is a circle?</h1>
                        <p>Take a compass and fix a pencil in it. Put its pointed leg on a point on a sheet of a paper. Open the other leg to some distance. Keeping the poined leg on the same point, rotate the other leg through one revolution. The figure formed is called a circle.
                        The fixed point is called the center of the circle and the fixed distance is called the radius of the circle.</p>

        <h1>Application of Circles</h1>
                <p>There are numerous uses for circles in architecture, landscaping, graphics, infrastructure, transportation, and other fields. Some of them are: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="list2">The circleâ€™s symmetrical properties are used by engineers to create a variety of objects, including clocks, cars, ships, airplanes, radios, telephones, wheelbarrows, air conditioners, rockets</li>
                    <li class="list2">Circles have contributed significantly to civilization. Just look at how the invention of the wheel transformed society and our methods of transportation.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list2">Architects use circles when designing buildings, especially when designing decorative features like domes, arches, round beams, and curved surfaces.</li>
                    <li class="list2">Circles are used by seismologists to determine and locate the center of earthquakes.</li>
                    <li class="list2">Circles are used by GPS to determine distance. It locates points and determines their separations from the satellite using a circle theory.</li>
